# CSYE6200_FinalProject: Bookstore Management System

Our project is a system aimed at managing books, transactions, and members in a public bookstore setting. Detailing all the actions such as user and admin login, returns and issues books, issuing the fines that come with late books, deleting bookings, etc. The purpose of the project is to provide a streamlined and efficient way for book management from those issuing the books and people receiving the books. The output of this system would be a better user experience and higher efficiency. The scope only covers the bookstore, but you can use this information in any kind of inventory-based operation in which you want a better way to manage. This project helps Northeastern students who struggle with book management with delays and hindrances. 

The project's scope includes creating and designing an intuitive and user-friendly user interface, integrating several features like searching books, issuing books, returning books, issuing fines, and maintaining a database to hold data about books, students, and transactions.

The admin assumes the role of a user with comprehensive access privileges within the system. The admin possesses the authority to access all information stored within the system. This includes the capacity to add books and members to the library, conduct searches within the book and member databases, and review details such as purchased books by members, due dates for book returns, and any associated penalties.

Conversely, Members have access to a subset of information within the system. They can view the books they have borrowed, along with details regarding the date of borrowing and the deadline for returning the book. Both Members and the Admin are required to log in to the library system using their unique username-ID and password credentials.
